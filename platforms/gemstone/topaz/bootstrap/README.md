Each of the directories in this directory contains the bootstrap .gs files needed for the release of that name.

A directory will be created for each 3.x.0 release and all versions of the 3.x release will share the files in the 3.x.0 directory until such time that there are code changes that are required to bootstrap the release.

Currently only the 3.6.1 release has required changes to the bootstrap files.

The platforms/gemstone/read_and_write_rowan_source.tpz scripts controls the generation of the full set of bootstrap .gs files.
