All Cypress classes are private to GemStone and are likely to be removed in a future release.

This class models a file URL according to (somewhat) RFC1738, see http://www.w3.org/Addressing/rfc1738.txt

Here is the relevant part of the RFC:

3.10 FILES

   The file URL scheme is used to designate files accessible on a
   particular host computer. This scheme, unlike most other URL schemes,
   does not designate a resource that is universally accessible over the
   Internet.

   A file URL takes the form:

       file://<host>/<path>

   where <host> is the fully qualified domain name of the system on
   which the <path> is accessible, and <path> is a hierarchical
   directory path of the form <directory>/<directory>/.../<name>.

   For example, a VMS file

     DISK$USER:[MY.NOTES]NOTE123456.TXT

   might become

     <URL:file://vms.host.edu/disk$user/my/notes/note12345.txt>

   As a special case, <host> can be the string "localhost" or the empty
   string; this is interpreted as `the machine from which the URL is
   being interpreted'.

   The file URL scheme is unusual in that it does not specify an
   Internet protocol or access method for such files; as such, its
   utility in network protocols between hosts is limited.

From the above we can conclude that the RFC says that the <path> part never starts or ends with a slash and is always absolute. If the last name can be a directory instead of a file is not specified clearly.

The path is stored as a SequenceableCollection of path parts.

Notes regarding non RFC features in this class:

- If the last path part is the empty string, then the FileUrl is referring to a directory. This is also shown with a trailing slash when converted to a String.

- The FileUrl has an attribute isAbsolute which signals if the path should be considered absolute or relative to the current directory. This distinction is not visible in the String representation of FileUrl, since the RFC does not have that.

- Fragment is supported (kept for historical reasons)
