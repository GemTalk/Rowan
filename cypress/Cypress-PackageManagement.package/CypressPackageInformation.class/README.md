All Cypress classes are private to GemStone and are likely to be removed in a future release.

CypressPackageInformation documents potential and actual packages for the Cypress Package Manager. 

Candidate package names come from class categories and from method categories beginning with an asterisk. Category names may contain more information than just the package name, such as logical subdivisions within a package or method categorization in addition to the package name. For example, a Package might be named X or Y-Z or whatever. Classes could be categorized as X, Y-Z, X-A, or Y-Z-A, and methods could be categorized as *X, *Y-Z, *X-A, *Y-Z-A, etc. (The various letters X, Y, Z, and A can represent almost any sequence of characters, in either uppercase, lowercase, or both. Package names are case-insensitive.)

There are four types of CypressPackageInformation objects:
 - Known Package - those which are known to represent real packages (e.g., Y-Z). In general, it is because there is a savedLocation specified.
 - Qualified Name - the name is a Known Package name qualified by further details, and cannot be used to represent a Known Package (e.g., X-accessing).
 - Conflicted Name - the name is a prefix of a Known Package name (e.g. given a Known Package named Y-Z, there can be no package named Y).
 - Unknown - the name could represent a package, but it is not known to do so.
